INTRODUCTION                                    *vaxe*
                                                *vaxe-introduction*

This plugin adds basic support for Haxe syntax, indenting, and compiling.  In
addition, it provides functions and features for advanced vim features such as
|omnifunc|, |makeprg|, and |ctags|, as well as supporting useful bundles such
as |tagbar|, |neocomplcache|, |snipmate|, and |powerline|. Also included is
syntax and support for Hxml.

Vaxe uses the Haxe compiler extensively to determine code completions, and
generate various metadata.  The compiler, in turn, uses sequences of compiler
directives in "hxml" files in order to specify build and output options,
similar to gnu makefiles.

Vaxe has two different "build modes" that designate how to find the hxml
file, as well as how to set up the |makeprg|.  If you're working with simple
projects, then the default mode will work just fine.  If you have a complex
project structure with many different sub-builds, then you may want to consider
using |vaxe-project-mode|.  You can set up an autocommand to set the project
hxml:

>
:autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead /project/* vaxe#ProjectMode("/project/project.hxml")
<

Keep in mind that the project mode will persist throughout your entire session.
If you wish to exit project mode, use the DefaultHxml command, or
vaxe#DefaultHxml function.  Also, the quickfix list and related compiler
information will always be in relation to the working directory at compilation
time.  It is a good idea to keep an hxml file in the root of your working
directory, and use vaxe to invoke the compiler there.

If you need to change the name of the hxml file often, it may be a good idea
to print the name of the build file in your statusline, to remind you which
file is being used for "make" and completions:

>
:autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.hx set statusline+=\ build:\ %{vaxe#CurrentBuild()}
<

BUILD MODES                                     *vaxe-build*

Default                                         *vaxe-default-mode*
                        This mode is used automatically any time a *.hx file
                        is opened.  It can be retriggered by calling
                        |vaxe#DefaultHxml|. Vaxe will search the project
                        path for the preferred file indicated by
                        |g:vaxe_prefer_hxml|, as well as searching for any
                        nmml files.

                        If it finds an nmml file, it will use that by default.
                        see |vaxe-nme-mode| for more details.

                        If it finds a preferred build file in the parent
                        directories of the currently edited file, it will set
                        a b:vaxe_hxml variable for the current buffer.
                        It sets a |makeprg| that has the following behavior:
                        It will cd to the preferred hxml directory, call the
                        compiler with the preferred hxml, and redirect errors
                        to standard out.

Project                                         *vaxe-project-mode*
                        This mode is used when |vaxe#ProjectHxml| is called.
                        It will set a g:vaxe_hxml variable that will
                        override any b:vaxe_hxml variables set by the default
                        method.  It also sets a |makeprg| that simply executes
                        the haxe compiler in the working directory,
                        and redirects errors to standard out.  Project mode
                        assumes that you will keep the same working directory
                        throughout your vim session.

NME Project                                      *vaxe-nme-mode*
                        This mode is used when |vaxe#ProjectNmml| is called,
                        or if an nmml file is detected on startup.
                        It will set a g:vaxe_nmml variable that will
                        override any b:vaxe_nmml variables set by the default
                        method.  It also sets a |makeprg| that simply executes
                        the nme command in the working directory,
                        and redirects errors to standard out.  Nme mode
                        assumes that you will keep the same working directory
                        throughout your vim session.  When this mode is active,
                        an hxml file is generated that contains information
                        used for completions.  It will be named the same as
                        the selectd nmml file, and be located in the same
                        directory, but will have an hxml extension.


COMMANDS                                         *vaxe-commands*

|DefaultHXML|           Call the |vaxe#DefaultHxml| function.  Accepts an
                        optional single argument that will specify the hxml or
                        nmml to use.

|ProjectHXML|           Call the |vaxe#ProjectHxml| function. Accepts an
                        optional single argument that will specify the hxml to
                        use.

|ProjectNmml|           Call the |vaxe#ProjectNmml| function.  Accepts an
                        optional single argument that will specify the nmml to
                        use.

|NmeTarget|             Call the |vaxe#NmeTarget| function.  It accepts an
                        optional single argument that will specify the target
                        to use.

|HaxeCtags|             Call the |vaxe#Ctags| function

FUNCTIONS                                        *vaxe-functions*

*vaxe#CompilerClassPaths*
                        Retrieve the class paths for the current build target.

*vaxe#Ctags*            Generate a ctags file for the current build target.
                        This function will use the compiler class paths for the
                        current build, which will include all standard
                        libraries, as well as libraries from included haxelibs.
                        vaxe also provides a tag description file that can
                        be used with |tagbar| if it is installed.

*vaxe#CurrentBuild*     Returns the current active project build file if it
                        is specified, else it will return the default build
                        file name if it exists. Accepts a single argument that
                        will specify the hxml to use.


*vaxe#DefaultHxml*      Find the preferred build file recursively in the
                        parents of the working directory. This function is
                        called automatically whenever any hx file is opened.
                        Accepts a single argument that will specify the hxml
                        to use.

*vaxe#HaxeComplete*     The |omnifunc| provided for vaxe.

*vaxe#OpenHxml*         Open the current build file specified with
                        |vaxe#DefaultHxml|, or |vaxe#ProjectHxml|. You can
                        easily add this function to a trigger:
                        >
                            map <leader>oh :call vaxe#OpenHxml()<CR>
                        <

*vaxe#ProjectHxml*      Find and select hxml files in the working directory.
                        Selecting a file with this method will enter
                        |vaxe-project-mode|.  If you have installed |tlib|,
                        then it will use |tlib#input#List| to select hxml
                        candidates. If you call this often, it makes sense to
                        map it to a leader action:
                        >
                            map <leader>ph : call vaxe#ProjectHxml()<CR>
                        <

*vaxe#ProjectNmml*      Find and select nmml files in the working directory.
                        Selecting a file with this method will enter
                        |vaxe-nme-mode|.  If you have installed |tlib|,
                        then it will use |tlib#input#List| to select hxml
                        candidates. If you call this often, it makes sense to
                        map it to a leader action:
                        >
                            map <leader>pn : call vaxe#ProjectNmml()<CR>
                        <

*vaxe#NmeTarget*
                        Calling this function will select a new nme target to
                        use for builds and completions.

*vaxe#ImportClass*      Calling this function on a given line will try to
                        import any classes that are given for the line.  E.g.
                        for this line:
                        >
                            var l = new haxe.FastList<Int>();
                        <
                        vaxe#ImportClass() will try to find the FastList
                        definition, and import it:
                        >
                            import haxe.FastList;
                            ...
                            var l = new FastList<Int>();
                        <
                        If you're missing the initial package prefix, vaxe
                        will try to find package definitions for the given
                        class name using ctags.  So, if ctags are generated,
                        it is also possible to resolve the import for this
                        line:
                        >
                            var l = new FastList<Int>();
                        >


ACTIVE TARGET                                      *omnifunc-active-target*

In some cases, an hxml file may specify multiple targets via a "--next"
directive.  The specified behavior for the compiler may be very different
betwen --next sections.

vaxe will use the first section it finds in order to generate completions.
It is possible to specify a different target by inserting a line like this into
your hxml:
>
    # vaxe
<
The target that vaxe uses is called the "active" target.  This target is used
for generating completions, as well as for determining current compiler class
paths, and for generating ctags.

SETTINGS                                        *vaxe-settings*

*g:vaxe_prefer_hxml*    The preferred name for hxml files to search for in
                        default build mode. The default is "build.hxml"

*g:vaxe_hxml*           A variable that indicates the |vaxe-project-mode|
                        build file.  It will override the |vaxe-default-mode|
                        setting if present.

*g:vaxe_prevent_completion_bufwrite_events*
                        vaxe uses the compiler to make completions.  This can
                        happen frequently, and causes the buffer to be written.
                        The default is "1" which prevents events.

*g:vaxe_nme_target*
                        In |vaxe-nme-mode|, vaxe will use this target for
                        builds and to generate completions.  Check the results
                        from "nme help" for more details
                        The following options are available:

MISC                                            *vaxe-misc*

Vaxe will change the errrorformat syntax if it finds "-D absolute_path" in the
current hxml.  This -D compiler switch adds the full path for files in trace
output, making it possible to jump to trace declarations in the quickfix
window.
